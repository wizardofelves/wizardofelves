# Hello!

My name's **Chris**. I'm going to write some posts about my personal experience with **Ruby on Rails**.

This first set of posts will be about how I upgraded an enterprise application from **Ruby 2.6** / **Rails 5.2** to **Ruby 3 and Rails 7.**

Along the way I ended up upgrading nearly all of the gems in a 200 line gemfile for the application as well.. so there's plenty of fun to talk about!

**See you soon!**

Chris
