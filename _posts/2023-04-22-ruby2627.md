## Ruby 2.6 -> Ruby 2.7.4, and the joy of Phusion passenger!

The application used a 1.x Phusion passenger with ruby 2.6 and I needed to go to to 2.7.4.

The  particular version of the phusion passenger docker image was built in 2019, and I needed to go to the current version. This involved a major version update of the container.

In order to complete this upgrade I would need to do address following:

- First - update and re-pin all of the Ubuntu packages for the base application container and dependencies from the new image
- Second, and more exciting - The application used system mime detection via mimemagic via the Paperclip gem to organize file uploads. I ran into an issue where certain file types were being reported incorrectly https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/file/+bug/1879019 and needed to explicitly pull older versions of https://github.com/file/file/ to avoid breaking changes with the application.

The actual upgrade of Ruby 2.6 -> 2.7.4 was quite uneventful.
