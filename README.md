# Hello!

I woke up a few years ago irritated that the application I worked day after day on was on an old version of Ruby, Rails, and outdated gems and patterns. Who would change it? Who would fix it?

"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not." - *Dr. Seuss, The Lorax*.

This is a blog of my adventures with Ruby, Rails, and maybe some other stuff too. 

have fun!
